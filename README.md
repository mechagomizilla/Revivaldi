# Revivaldi
My custom CSS for Vivaldi, inspired by Opera, Firefox and Edge.

This is a work in progress. This was forked from Operaldi on 2025-09-16 in order to rewrite my own CSS on top of it to better support transparency. My own css code, labeled "Legacy.css", will gradually be merged with Operaldi over the next few weeks until I'm satisfied with it. I hope I will be able to use new code from upstream easily, but there is a large chance that my code will diverge greatly.

Main features to add:
- More flexibility (tabs and pannel on either side and horizontal tabs)
- Bookmark bar
- Anything else from my own code

My recommendations:

Command chains:

  1) Hide tab bar and panel with web apps with one button <img width="39" height="39" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da4720b8-3c31-431d-86ab-6cb95e4e5526" />

  <img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8857582-6aec-48e4-aac2-3e9c50867f3d" />

  - You can also set it as mouse gesture

  2) Copy URL address with one button <img width="40" height="39" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61577936-e092-4873-98b0-83dfcb926339" />
